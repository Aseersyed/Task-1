Currently pursuing undergraduate technical education(That's what i tell my relatives)<br>
in National Institute of Technology,Trichy.<br>
19 years of age and a die hard fan of Sports. <br>
Had it not been for an engineer, I would have been found batting alongside Virat Kohli<br>
or competing with Usain Bolt right now.<br> 
I love to spend time in the field.I basically like doing stuffs that are physically challenging.<br>
Pushing myself to do what i have never done before is what i live for.<br><br><br><p/>

I was brought up with all the Islamic moral values and the Islamic culture.<br>
I have got two elder siblings, A bro and a sis.<br>
My dad happens to be a Mathematics teacher <br>

<p id="b3" style="text-align:left;"><br><br><br><br><br><br>I studied in Delhi Public School, Ranchi for 13 long years which didn't seem long at all.<br>
Over the years my school became my second home and I had a big family over there too.<br>
I dunno how but i happened to be the typical "Teacher's pet".<br>
I didn't study much but when i did i made sure my parents spot it :P<br>
Bidding adieu to my school after 13 lovely years wasn't easy.</p>

<p id="b4" style="text-align:right;"><br><br><br><br><br><br>As i grew up i discovered that i have two roads to choose from.<br>
One was called 'Engineering' and the other 'Medical'.<br>
Kids aren't allowed to even think of a third, leave alone opting one.<br>
I dunno why I took the first road and began working to get into an IIT.<br>
Honestly,i never thought of NITs till i appeared for JEE(Advanced) :P<br>
which forced me to reach out to NIT Trichy for rescue.<br>
Many of my friends went into IITs but i had no regrets.(Because a lot of them didn't :P)<br>
But frankly, there's a war going on outside to get into a reputed engg college which isn't worth it.</p>

<p id="b5" style="text-align:left;"><br><br><br><br><br>The journey to become an engineer actually started way back <br>
when I had absolutely no idea what engineering actually was.<br>
Only after i went into NIT Trichy did i realise that it's officially an engineering college<br> 
but is actually a place for the students to follow their passion and do what they actually love doing.<br>
There are a hell lot of things to discover in this world and i am seriously after the one i am made for.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
